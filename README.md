# gun_violence_education

Inspiration: As students of an educational institution, we assume that schools are a safe space for us to learn and explore our interests. However, to see it being jeopardized due to a weapon has long lasting effects on people that experience a school shooting. In some cases, students may experience symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and have difficulty concentrating on their studies or participating in school activities. Additionally, students who have lost friends or loved ones in these events may struggle with grief and feelings of isolation. So, this topic not only needs to be addressed to protect innocent people from harm's way but it also holds an emotional connection to us as students of schools.

About App: The app provides information about school shootings in DC from the years 2020-2023 and displays it in an easy-to-understand format that has details about specific shootings. We developed the graphs using ArcGIS, as it is a great tool to visualize various types of data. We implemented these graphs as tables into an app that was made with the Flutter plug-in.
